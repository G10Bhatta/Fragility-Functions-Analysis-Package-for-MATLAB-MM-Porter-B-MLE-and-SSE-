%	This package develops experimental or empirical fragility functions for 
%	a systems based on damage observations and corresponding intensity measures 
%	obtained from either experiments or field-surveys, respectively. 

%	Fragility functions (or curves) are used to visually represent the 
%	probability of failure or damage to a structure (or system) in relation 
% 	to different levels of seismic intensity or loading. 
% 	The fragility functions can be modelled using cumulative distribution 
% 	functions (CDFs) defined by a set of parameters 
% 	(also known as ‘parametric fragility functions). 
% 	These parameters can be estimated using Method-of-Moments (MM) or Method A 
% 	(Porter, K. et al., 2006; Porter, Keith et al., 2007), 
% 	Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) (Cremen and Baker, 2019; Rota et al., 
% 	2008; Shinozuka et al., 2000), Sum of Squared Errors (SSE) 
% 	(Baker, J. W., 2015; Porter, K. et al., 2006; Porter, Keith et al., 2010) 
% 	or Porter Method B (PB) (Porter, K. et al., 2006; Porter, Keith et al., 2007). 
% 	MLE is generally preferred over the MM and SSE (Cremen and Baker, 2019;

This is the main file where you input your data,damage states and options for plotting fragility functions. 

% 	This code develops experimental or empirical fragility functions for 
% 	a systems based on damage observations and corresponding intensity measures 
%	obtained from either experiments or field-surveys, respectively. 

% Required information:
% 	1.  Damage state titles (currently, has max limit of 3 damage states, can
% 		be extended if required. 
% 	2.  Intensity Measures (IMs) for the observed damage
% 	3.  Maximum IMs the specimens withstood without reaching the damage state
% 	4.  Figure plot characteristics
% 	5.  Damage state colors for figures
% 	6. Additional paramaters such as:
%   		a. Checking only lognormal CDF, 
%   		b. Contraining ispersion with a range or to a value, 
%   		c. Whether only unique IMs are to be used for analysis
%   		d. Pierce's criteria to eliminate outliers (Ross 2003)

% Output:
% 	1. Gives CDF function parameters in the command window
% 	2. Plots the CDF functions

				Fragility_FDC_A.m

% 	This gives the lognormal CDF parameters (median and dispersion) for given
% 	damage data using the Method-of-Moments (MM) or Method A in Porter(2007).
% 	Steps include:
%   		1. Runs pierces criteria to eliminate outliers.
%   		2. Calculates the median and random dispersion. 
%  		 3. Plots the CDF function and empirical CDF (ECDF)
%   		4. Conducts Lilliefors Goodness of fit testing (Lilliefors 1967; Annex H FEMA P-58
%       		2012)
%   		5. It can conduct normality checks other than Lilliefors by running
%      			R=normalitytest(DS_intensity_peirces) below.By default, it is an empty matrix, R=[]; 
%  		6. the median can be updated if dispersion is constrained to a value or
%       		if uncertainty dispersion is introduced by running sections of the code
%      			 where indicated

				Fragility_FDC_B.m

% 	In this code, the data are divided into bins depending upon the intensity measures 
% 	such that each bin contains approximately the same number of specimens. 
% 	For each bin, the collapse fraction (i.e. number of failed specimens/ total number of specimens) 
% 	and average intensity measures are calculated. 
% 	A linear equation y=mx+c  is fitted to the inverse standard normal distribution 
% 	of the fractions vs. the natural logarithm of the average intensity measures plot. 
% 	Then, the median and random dispersion parameters of the lognormal CDF are estimated 
% 	Refer to (Porter, K. et al., 2006; Porter, Keith et al., 2007) for detailed description of this method. 
% 	(Porter, K. et al., 2006) recommends using SSE method approach over PB to fit binary failure data 
% 	i.e. collapse fractions include 0 and 1 and SSE is found to avoid errors that may arise with 
% 	bin-average intensity measures. 

% Steps include:
%   1. Sorting the intensity measures in ascedning order.
%   2. Creating a number of bins such that each bin has approcimately equal number of specimens
%   3. Obtaining average intensity measures for each bin 
%   4. Fitting a linear equation y=mx+c  to the inverse standard normal distribution 
%       of the fractions vs. the natural logarithm of the average intensity
%       measures plot. I have provided three options if the proposed
%       equation by Porter Method B doesn't work (i.e. option 1) 
% NOTE:
%    There are three options:
%   Option 1:
%       The prescribed formula to obtain norm inverse of collapse fraction by porter is :
%               yj=norminv((mj+1)./(Mj+1))
%       It doesn't give values for norminv(0) and norminv(1). Hence, non-convergent. 
%   Option 2:
%       The collapse fractions are calculated as below, where, approximate collapse 
%       fractions are usef for fractions equal to 0 and 1.
        %{
            fr=mj./Mj;                              
            fr(N)=mj(N)./Nj;
            fr(fr==1)=0.999;               %Approximation to 1
            fr(fr==0)=0.001;               %Approximation to 0
            yj=norminv(fr);
            %}
%Option 3: involves fitting linear curve to mj./Mj vs. average demand in
%real space. Therefore, doesn't have issue of binary data. 

%   5. Calculating the median and random dispersion
%   6. Plots the CDF function and empirical CDF (ECDF)
%   7. Conducts Lilliefors Goodness of fit testing (Lilliefors 1967; Annex H FEMA P-58
%       2012) for the average demands. 
%   8. the median can be updated if dispersion is constrained to a value or
%       if uncertainty dispersion is introduced by running sections of the code
%       below where indicated
